    "## Defining the SKIP GP Model\n",

    "\n",
    "- First, we use only a 1 dimensional `GridInterpolationKernel` (e.g., by passing `num_dims=1`). The idea of SKIP is to use a product of 1 dimensional `GridInterpolationKernel`s instead of a single `d` dimensional one.\n",
    "- Next, we create a `ProductStructureKernel` that wraps our 1D `GridInterpolationKernel` with `num_dims=18`. This specifies that we want to use product structure over 18 dimensions, using the 1D `GridInterpolationKernel` in each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you've explored the rest of the package, you may be wondering what the differences between `AdditiveKernel`, `AdditiveStructureKernel`, `ProductKernel`, and `ProductStructureKernel` are. The `Structure` kernels (1) assume that we want to apply a single base kernel over a fully decomposed dataset (e.g., every dimension is additive or has product structure), and (2) are significantly more efficient as a result, because they can exploit batch parallel operations instead of using for loops."
